        <h1> Sai Krishna snips a play</h1>
        <h6>SAM AVERAGE_Percy Mackaye_</h6>

        <p>An intrenchment in Canada, near Niagara Falls, in the year 1814.
     Night, shortly before dawn._</p>

     <p>_On the right, the dull glow of a smouldering wood fire ruddies the
     earthen embankment, the low-stretched outline of which forms, with
     darkness, the scenic background._</p>

     <p>_Near the centre, left, against the dark, a flag with stars floats
     from its standard._</p>

    <p> _Beside the fire_, ANDREW, _reclined, gazes at a small frame in his
     hand; near him is a knapsack, with contents emptied beside it_.</p>

     <p>_On the embankment_, JOEL., _with a gun, paces back and forth, a
     blanket thrown about his shoulders_.</p>

<h6 class="name Joel.">JOEL.</h6>
<p class="direction"> [_With a singing call._]</p>
<p class="speech">. Four o'clock!--All's well!</p>

    <p class="direction"> [_Jumping down from the embankment, he approaches the fire._</p>

<h6 class="name JOEL">JOEL.</h6>
<p class="speech"> By God, Joel., it's bitter.</p>

<h6 class="name">JOEL.</h6>
<p class="direction"> [_Rubbing his hands over the coals._] </p>
    <p class="speech">A mite sharpish.</p>

    <h6 class="name JOEL">ANDREW.</h6>
<p class="direction">[_Looks up eagerly._]</p>
    <p class="speech">What?</p>

<h6 class="name Joel.">JOEL.</h6>

<p>Cuts sharp, for Thanksgivin'.</p>
<h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>
<p class="direction">[_Sinks back, gloomily._] Oh! [_A pause._] </p>
    <p class="speech">I wondered you should
agree with me. You meant the weather. I meant--[_A pause again._</p>

<h6 class="name Joel.">JOEL.</h6>

<p>Well, Andy, what'd you mean?</p>

<h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>

<p>Life.</p>

<h6 class="name Joel.">JOEL.</h6>

<p>Shucks!</p>
<h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>
<p class="direction">[_To himself._] Living!</p>

<h6 class="name Joel.">JOEL.</h6>

<p class="direction">[_Sauntering over left, listens._] Hear a rooster crow?</p>
<h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>
<p class="speech">No. What are you doing?</p>

<h6 class="name Joel.">JOEL.</h6>

<p>Tiltin' the flag over crooked in the dirt. That's our signal.</p>
<h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>
<p class="speech">Nothing could be more appropriate, unless we buried it--buried
it in the dirt!</p>

<h6 class="name Joel.">JOEL.</h6>

<p class="speech">She's to find us where the flag's turned down. I fixed that with
the sergeant all right. The rooster crowin' 's _her_ watchword for us.</p>

<p class="speech">An eagle screaming,<p>
    <h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>
    <p class="Speech">that would have been better.</p>
<p class="direction">[_Rising._] Ah! [_He laughs painfully._</p>

<h6 class="name Joel.">JOEL.</h6>

<p class="speech">Hush up, Andy! The nearest men ain't two rods away. You'll wake
'em. Pitch it low.</p>
<h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>
<p>Don't be alarmed. I'm coward enough.</p>


<h6 class="name">ELLEN.</h6>

<p class="direction"> [_Her face lighting up._]</p>

<p class="speech">Oh! and you _dare_! It's _right_?</p>

<h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>

<p class="direction">[_Moving from her, with a hoarse laugh._]</p>

<p class="speech">_Dare?_ Dare I be
damned by God and all his angels? Ha! Come, we're slow.</p>

JOEL. Time enough.

<h6 class="name">ELLEN.</h6>


<p class="direction">[_Sinking upon_ JOEL'S _knapsack as a seat, leans her head on her
hands, and looks strangely at_ ANDREW.] </p>

<p class="speech">I'd better have written, I'm afraid.</p>

<h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>

<p class="direction">[_Controlling his emotion._]</p>
<p class="speech">Now, don't take it that way. I've considered it all.</p>

<h6 class="name">ELLEN.</h6>

<p class="direction">[_With deep quiet._] </p>

<p class="speech">Blasphemously?</p>

<h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>

<p class="speech">Reasonably, my brave wife. When I enlisted, I did so in a dream.
I dreamed I was called to love and serve our country. But that dream is
shattered. </p>

<h6 class="name">ELLEN.</h6>

<p class="speech">Are you saying this--for my sake? What of "God and his angels"?</p>

<h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>

<p class="direction">[_Not looking at her._] </p>
<p class="speech">If we had a just cause--a cause of
liberty like that in Seventy-six; if to serve one's country meant to
serve God and his angels--then, yes; a man might put away wife and
child. He might say: "I will not be a husband, a father; </p>

<h6 class="name">ELLEN.</h6>

<p class="direction">[_Slowly._] </p>
<p class="speech">So, then, when little Andy grows up----</p>

<h6 class="name">ANDREW.</h6>

<p class="direction">[_Groaning._] </p>

<p class="speech">I say that the only thing----</p>

<h6 class="name">ELLEN.</h6>

<p class="speech">I am to tell him----</p>
