        <h6>SAM AVERAGE_Percy Mackaye_</h6>

        <p>An intrenchment in Canada, near Niagara Falls, in the year 1814.
     Night, shortly before dawn._</p>

     <p>_On the right, the dull glow of a smouldering wood fire ruddies the
     earthen embankment, the low-stretched outline of which forms, with
     darkness, the scenic background._</p>

     <p>_Near the centre, left, against the dark, a flag with stars floats
     from its standard._</p>

    <p> _Beside the fire_, ANDREW, _reclined, gazes at a small frame in his
     hand; near him is a knapsack, with contents emptied beside it_.</p>

     <p>_On the embankment_, JOEL, _with a gun, paces back and forth, a
     blanket thrown about his shoulders_.</p>

        <p>JOEL. [_With a singing call._] Four o'clock!--All's well!

     [_Jumping down from the embankment, he approaches the fire._</p>

<p>ANDREW. By God, Joel, it's bitter.</p>

<p>JOEL. [_Rubbing his hands over the coals._] A mite sharpish.</p>

<p>ANDREW. [_Looks up eagerly._] What?</p>

<p>JOEL. Cuts sharp, for Thanksgivin'.</p>

<p>ANDREW. [_Sinks back, gloomily._] Oh! [_A pause._] I wondered you should
agree with me. You meant the weather. I meant--[_A pause again._</p>

<p>JOEL. Well, Andy, what'd you mean?</p>

<p>ANDREW. Life.</p>

<p>JOEL. Shucks!</p>

<p>ANDREW. [_To himself._] Living!</p>

<p>JOEL. [_Sauntering over left, listens._] Hear a rooster crow?</p>

<p>ANDREW. No. What are you doing?</p>

<p>JOEL. Tiltin' the flag over crooked in the dirt. That's our signal.</p>

<p>ANDREW. Nothing could be more appropriate, unless we buried it--buried
it in the dirt!</p>

<p>JOEL. She's to find us where the flag's turned down. I fixed that with
the sergeant all right. The rooster crowin' 's _her_ watchword for us.</p>

<p>ANDREW. An eagle screaming, Joel: that would have been better.
[_Rising._] Ah! [_He laughs painfully._</p>

<p>JOEL. Hush up, Andy! The nearest men ain't two rods away. You'll wake
'em. Pitch it low.</p>

<p>ANDREW. Don't be alarmed. I'm coward enough.</p>
